# verilog-tests
Simple repo that will hold all of my verilog module tests, for educational purposes

### Goals
- Develop a toolchain to allow me to develop and simulate verilog on my Linux computer,\
and not have to use the garbage software we use in my universities lab.
- Probably learn things idk

### Current modules
- Simple parameterized counter

### Future planned modules
- Parametric RAM
- Maybe some more niche things later on
